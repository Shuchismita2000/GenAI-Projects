ðŸš€ Gen-AI Experiments
Welcome to my Gen-AI Projects repository! This is where I explore, experiment, and learn about Generative AI by building hands-on projects.

ðŸ”¬ Current Experiment: AI Book Recommendation Chatbot
The first project in this series is an AI-powered Book Recommendation Chatbot, where I'm experimenting with:
âœ… Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
âœ… Pinecone for vector search
âœ… LangChainâ€™s Hugging Face integration
âœ… Ollama for conversational AI

This repository will grow as I continue to learn and experiment with new Gen-AI techniques. Stay tuned for more exciting projects! ðŸš€
