To develop an AI agent that optimizes hyper-personalized customer experiences in the Retail/CPG domain, as described in the previous problem statement, a wide variety of data is needed. Here's an overview of the key data sources that would be essential for building this AI-driven solution:

### 1. **Customer Data**

- **Demographic Data**: Basic customer attributes such as age, gender, location, income level, etc.
    
- **Behavioral Data**: Detailed tracking of customer actions across various touchpoints like website visits, clicks, browsing history, time spent on pages, mobile app interactions, and past purchases.
    
- **Purchase History**: Detailed records of past transactions, including product categories, purchase frequency, basket size, and purchase timings (e.g., seasonality, time of day).
    
- **Loyalty Program Data**: If applicable, data related to loyalty program memberships, accumulated points, rewards, and redemption patterns.
    
- **Customer Feedback and Reviews**: Data from customer reviews, satisfaction surveys, and NPS (Net Promoter Score) to gauge customer sentiment and preferences.
    

### 2. **Product Data**

- **Product Catalog**: Comprehensive information about products, including descriptions, categories, pricing, sizes, and other attributes like color, weight, brand, and packaging.
    
- **Inventory Data**: Real-time data on inventory levels for each product at different locations (warehouse, store, online).
    
- **Product Demand Forecasting Data**: Historical sales data and predictive models that can estimate demand for products over time, helping to manage inventory and guide recommendations.
    
- **Product Life Cycle Data**: Data on new products, seasonal products, and products in clearance or promotion stages.
    
- **Promotions and Discounts**: Historical and real-time data on product promotions, discounts, and special offers that are being or have been run.
    

### 3. **Customer Journey Data**

- **Multi-Channel Interaction Data**: Information on customer interactions across various channels (web, mobile app, physical stores, email, social media, etc.). This would include page views, clicks, interactions with chatbots, cart abandonment events, and time spent per channel.
    
- **Contextual Data**: Real-time contextual information such as location (GPS data), device type (mobile, desktop), time of interaction, and browsing context (e.g., shopping vs. research).
    
- **Cross-Channel Behavioral Data**: Data showing how customers move between different channels (e.g., from browsing a product on a mobile app to purchasing it on a desktop or picking it up in a store).
    

### 4. **Sales and Transaction Data**

- **Sales Transactions**: Details about each sale, including time of purchase, location, payment method, quantity, product price, and any applied discounts or coupons.
    
- **Abandoned Cart Data**: Data on customers who added items to their cart but did not complete the purchase, including reasons for abandonment, if available (e.g., price sensitivity, stock availability).
    
- **Customer Retention and Churn Data**: Insights into whether a customer has churned or made repeat purchases over time, including details on frequency and recency of purchases.
    

### 5. **External Data Sources**

- **Market and Competitor Data**: Pricing and promotional data from competitors, trends in the broader market, and insights into product performance relative to competitors.

- **Weather and Event Data**: Data related to external factors like weather conditions or local events (e.g., holidays, festivals) that may influence purchasing behavior in specific regions.
    
- **Economic Indicators**: External data on economic trends that could affect consumer spending patterns, such as inflation rates or shifts in disposable income.
    

### 6. **Operational Data**

- **Supply Chain Data**: Information related to product availability, logistics, and shipping times, which can affect product recommendations based on real-time stock levels and shipping capabilities.
    
- **Store-Level Data**: For physical retail, store-level data such as foot traffic, in-store sales, promotions, and sales associatesâ€™ interactions with customers.
    
- **Customer Service Interactions**: Data on customer inquiries, complaints, or support requests, including interaction logs from call centers, chatbots, and support tickets.

### 8. **Real-Time Data**

- **Session Data**: Real-time information about customer behavior as they browse the website or app, including mouse movements, clicks, and scroll depth.
    
- **Event-Triggered Data**: Real-time data streams that trigger actions or recommendations based on customer actions (e.g., viewed a product, added to cart, cart abandoned).
    
- **Price Sensitivity Data**: Real-time data on how a customer reacts to changes in price or promotions, helping to determine optimal discounting strategies.
